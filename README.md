## Part 1: How to interact with the work: Iteration three
1. Press the mouse to click on the screen.
2. Press the mouse again and again to click on the screen.
3. Refresh the page to see a new composition.

## Part 2: Details of my individual approach to animating the group
- I have chosen User Input, in other words interaction, as my individual approach.
- In addition to the group task, I added the water ripple effect as my animation, which is not a part of any other group member's visual outcome.
- I have been inspired by the selected artwork: *Wheels of fortune* by Pacita Abad, and water ripple visual effect. *Wheels of fortune* has a blue background which reminded me of water, and that connects with the water ripples. Both the artwork and water ripples are aesthetically pleasing. For images of references that inspire me, please see below.

- There are mainly two technique I used:
    1. **A technique to create the basic effect**: **Mouse Ripple**, which is sourced from Happy coding (Link to the technique: https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/input/mouse-ripple). There are mainly two reasons I refer to it: Firstly, the code meets the requirement of incorporating User Input via mouse clicking. Secondly, the concentric circle resembles the form of water ripples effectively.
    2. **A technique from outside the course**: function **pow()** is used to create two visual effects: one is the exponential increase in water ripple's size, and the other one is gradual vanishment of each water ripple when it increases the size. In this way, I hope to create an organic and natural water ripple animation. (Link to the technique: https://p5js.org/reference/p5/pow/)
